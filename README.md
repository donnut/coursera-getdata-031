 - run_analysis.R

## Requirements
The dataset mentioned above needs to be downloaded and unzipped in the same directory as the
script run_analysis.R. The script requires the R library "dplyr" to be installed. After running
the script a new file summarized_means.txt is created.

## Description of results
The "run_analysis.R" script results in the file "summarized_means.txt". The CodeBook.md file describes to contents of this files.
